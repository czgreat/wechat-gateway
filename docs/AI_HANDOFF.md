# AI Handoff Guide

**Language:** English | [中文](AI_HANDOFF.zh-CN.md)

Use this file when handing `wechat-gateway` to an AI coding assistant. It gives the assistant enough context to make useful changes without depending on private deployment history.

## First 15 Minutes

1. Read `README.md`, this file, and `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.
2. Inspect the repository layout table in `README.md`.
3. Run the validation command before editing anything substantial.
4. Confirm whether the task is documentation, tests, local deployment, or product code.
5. Keep all private credentials, state, media, and production data outside the repository.

## Project Summary

WeChat Gateway provides an Express HTTP surface, local static UI, QR-assisted session flow, persistent state storage, and optional downstream integrations.

## Important Paths

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `server.js` | Express server, gateway logic, and API routes |
| `public/` | Local browser UI assets |
| `docker-entrypoint.sh` | Container startup helper |
| `.env.example` | Public-safe environment template |
| `docker-compose.example.yml` | Container deployment example |

## Good First Tasks

- Split the large server into route/service modules
- Add API request/response examples
- Add integration tests with mocked downstream services
- Add admin UI safeguards for secret handling

## Context To Provide To An AI Assistant

- The repository URL and branch.
- Your operating system and runtime versions.
- The exact command that fails or the exact workflow you want improved.
- Sanitized logs with secrets removed.
- Whether you are using local development, Docker, or manual deployment.
- Any constraints around privacy, public sharing, or supported platforms.

## Suggested Prompt

```text
You are working in the wechat-gateway repository. Read README.md, docs/DEPLOYMENT.md, and docs/AI_HANDOFF.md first. Keep changes small, preserve public-safe examples, do not add real secrets, and run the documented validation command before summarizing changes.
```

## Guardrails

- Do not add private `.env` values, API keys, cookies, webhook secrets, local IP addresses, production URLs, personal records, or generated artifacts.
- Prefer focused tests over broad rewrites.
- Keep public examples generic and runnable on a clean machine.
- Update both English and Chinese docs when changing user-facing instructions.
- If deployment behavior changes, update `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` and `docs/DEPLOYMENT.zh-CN.md` in the same change.

## Definition Of Done

- The requested behavior or documentation change is complete.
- Validation commands pass, or any skipped check is explicitly explained.
- README links still work.
- No private data or generated artifacts are committed.
